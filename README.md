#Modules

Want to consolidate personal modules (mostly Perl for now) to use in scripts. This provides a central location for my modules by setting `PERL5LIB` variable in my `.bash_profile`.

Add the directory to the Perl environment include path:
>export  PERL5LIB=~/Dropbox/Development/Modules

###To Do:
* Add modules for other languages
